## Raspberry Pi Training in Camp CircleCity

The [Circle City Con 4.0](https://circlecitycon.com/camp-circle-events/) was
held on June 9-11, 2017. It was not a practical training course but I found
that the materials in the course can be useful for the team.  
Here are useful materials that I have learned in the training.

* [Basic Pi](https://iu.box.com/s/k54zrmzdmjstlg9qlejdx75l1w0ce381)
* [Advanced Raspberry Pi](https://iu.box.com/s/xf74bznz7owyj6i3fnv0ltinob8ym1oh)
